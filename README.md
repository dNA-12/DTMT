# DTMT
# D - Damaged T - Tooling M - Management and T - Tracking 

An application created to manage and track damaged tooling within a machining faucility. Damaged Tooling Management and Tracking. The goal of this application is create a database to track damaged tooling within a machining facility and send valuable data and insight on said tooling to an engineering department for further investigation. 
UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

# Application Make-up
DTMT uses Tkinter to render a simple display to a user and allows them to input their employee information and enter the damaged tooling into the database. 

The two main databases, in this stage of development, use SQLite3. Currently, two main databases are being engineered - Employee and Damaged Tooling

Later in development, matplotlib will be used to display tooling information in a human readable manner to the engineering department. As will Pandas for further data manipulation and analysis. All this infomation should come from the Employee and Damaged Tooling Databases.
